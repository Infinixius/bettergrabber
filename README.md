# bettergrabber

proof of concept discord token logger aimed at BetterDiscord users

this code is for educational purposes. if you use it with malicious intent, you are a dickhead.

## how does it work

essentially, if betterdiscord is installed, insert a malicious piece of code into the end of a random plugin. once the plugin is reloaded, the malicious code is executed, and the client's username, ip, email, and token are all sent to a webhook.
